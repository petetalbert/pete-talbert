### Hello!

My name is Pete Talbert, and I work as a data analyst in Minnesota. I have only been doing this line of work for a little over 3 years, and I have worked exclusively in educational settings, both higher ed and K-12. Being fairly new to the world of data and statistics, I felt that starting a blog would allow me to document my learning while at the same time help other beginners.

### Education

**M.A. in Organizational Leadership, Policy, and Development, 2017**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Studies  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minor in Educational Psychology, Quantitative Methods in Education (QME)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*University of Minnesota - Twin Cities*

### Purpose of site

I hope this site can help others who are learning data analysis, are interested in education data, or both. Most posts will focus on tools and programming techniques in R, SQL, and Tableau, but I hope they will touch on topics in education as well. I am especially interested in educational measurement and how assessment can improve student outcomes, so there may be some fundamentals of measurement stuff here as well.

Lastly, I try to remember this Bible verse whenever I am learning something new. Cheers!
