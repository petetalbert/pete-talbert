### Hello!

My name is Pete Talbert, and I work as a data analyst in Minnesota. I have only been doing this line of work for 3 years, and I have worked exclusively in education settings, both higher ed and K-12.

### Education

**M.A. in Organizational Leadership, Policy, and Development, 2017**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Studies  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minor in Educational Psychology, Quantitative Methods in Education (QME)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*University of Minnesota - Twin Cities*


**B.A. in Philosophy, 2010**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*University of Minnesota - Twin Cities*

### Purpose of site

I hope this site can help others who are learning data analysis, are interested in education data, or both. Most posts will focus on learning tools and programming languages like R, SQL, and Tableau, but I hope they will touch on topics in education as well. I am especially interested in educational measurement and how assessment can improve student outcomes. So there may be some fundamentals of measurement stuff here as well.

Lastly, I try to remember this Bible verse whenever I'm learning something new. Cheers!
