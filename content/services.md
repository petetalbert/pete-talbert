I am a data analyst in the Twin Cities, specializing in the K-12, higher education, and non-profit sectors. I have worked in the field for over four years, and know both the database and analytical/visualization components deeply. I work hard to understand business and end user needs, and build revealing and elegant solutions.

I offer data-related services to companies and organizations in the following technologies:

* SQL (primarily SQL Server and Oracle)
* Tableau
* R 
* ETL (primarily SSIS package development/deployment)

Whether it's an ad hoc research project or an on-going dashboard or reporting need, I am here to help!

Pete Talbert, *Data Analyst*
