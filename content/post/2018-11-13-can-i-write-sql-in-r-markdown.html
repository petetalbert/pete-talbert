<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This is just a quick test as to how a SQL snipet shows in a markdown file and on a website. See below.</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>select personID
    , endYear
    , grade
    , ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by personID order by endYear, case when grade  = &#39;KG&#39; then &#39;00&#39; else grade end) as rowNum
from #enroll3</code></pre>
