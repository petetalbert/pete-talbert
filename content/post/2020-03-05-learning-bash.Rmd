Hello all!

So I just bought a used MacBook Pro in order to learn Linux, bash, shell scripting, etc. This post is just to test that I can write bash code in an `.Rmd` file and it will show on my blog correctly.

```{bash}
ls
```

Hey, that's pretty cool! It looks like it is showing the directory where this `.Rmd` file lives. 

```{bash}
cd /
ls
```
