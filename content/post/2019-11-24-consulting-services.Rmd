Hello all!

I have not posted on this site since March, and I feel terrible about it. I know no one reads this, but personally it was a goal of mine to keep my skills up-to-date by forcing myself to blog about them.

All that being said, I have spent the last year doing a few part-time consulting projects, and I have really enjoyed it! My plan is for this website to be a personal website for blogging and for advertising my services. I offer data-related services to companies and organizations in the following technologies:

* SQL (primarily SQL Server and Oracle)
* Tableau
* R 

If your company or organization needs data analysis servicies in these areas, please reach out!
