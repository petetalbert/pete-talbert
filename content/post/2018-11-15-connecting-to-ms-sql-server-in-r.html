<p>There are dozens of ways to connect to an MS SQL Server database in R. You can use a number of packages, and within those packages, there are various methods for connecting and running SQL queries via an R script.</p>
<p>The easiest method I’ve found for a traditional <em>Windows</em> <em>user</em> <em>with</em> <em>access</em> <em>to</em> <em>an</em> <em>MS</em> <em>SQL</em> <em>Server</em> <em>instance</em> is what I’m going to demonstrate.</p>

<h3>Setting up a System DSN</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In Windows, if you hit the start menu and search for “odbc”, you’ll get an app called “ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit).” Open that.</li>
<li>Find the System DSN tab, and choose Add. I always choose SQL Server Native Client 11.0 (don’t ask me why). Hit finish.</li>
<li>Name it something (maybe the same name as the instance name), and the full server name. I just click through all the following steps and choose to use Windows Authentication. Hit finish.</li>
</ol>

<h3>RStudio set up</h3>
<p>Once you have the system DSN set up above, calling that is simple!</p>
<p>Install and call up the DBI and odbc packages like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;DBI&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;odbc&quot;)

library(DBI)
library(odbc)</code></pre>
<p>From there, you can connect to the instance:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>con &lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &quot;DSN name from step above&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now that you have a connection established you can run any SQL query you like by sending a query and then fetching:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query &lt;- dbSendQuery(con, &quot;select * from table&quot;)
df &lt;- dbFetch(query)</code></pre>
<p>I’ve found this to be a lot easier than trying to enter all the ODBC connection string details in an R function. Instead, using the Windows ODBC wizard saves all that info in the System Data Source, and you just tell R to go out and reference it.</p>
