      <description>I’m very much a beginner when it comes to any formal programming. So I feel like my first real practice should be with for loops, which are a staple of programming concepts.
Much of what is below is taken from Hadley Wickham’s R for Data Science, in particular, Chapter 21 on iteration.

      <description>In educational data analysis, I am constantly looking at counts and proportions. I’ve found the easiest way to display these results with categorical variables like demographics is to use stacked bar charts and especially 100% stacked charts.

      <description>Hello!
This is my very first post; just a quick test as to how a SQL snippet shows in a markdown file and on a website. See below.
select personID, endYear, grade, ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by personID order by endYear, case when grade = &amp;#39;KG&amp;#39; then &amp;#39;00&amp;#39; else grade end) as rowNumfrom #enroll3</description>
