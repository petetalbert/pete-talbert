      <description>I’m very much a beginner when it comes to any formal programming. So I feel like my first real practice should be with for loops, which are a staple of programming concepts.
Much of what is below is taken from Hadley Wickham’s R for Data Science, in particular, Chapter 21 on iteration.
Baumann datasetI’m going to use the one of the datasets that comes with the car package, called Baumann.</description>

      <description>IntroOften with education data, I need to pivot data to go from long format to wide. For instance, I often have test scores for different test subjects of a single assessment. For one student, I will have to rows, one for one subject and one for another. This also happens for strands and domains of a test.

      <description>In educational data analysis, I am constantly looking at counts and proportions. I’ve found the easiest way to display these results with categorical variables like demographics is to use stacked bar charts and especially 100% stacked charts.
I am using much of what is discussed here out of the context of ggplotAssist.
ggplot2First, for this post, I am using the following packages and mtcars as a dataset. I always make sure my dataframes are tibbles (probably not necessary).</description>

      <description>There are dozens of ways to connect to an MS SQL Server database in R. You can use a number of packages, and within those packages, there are various methods for connecting and running SQL queries via an R script.
The easiest method I’ve found for a traditional Windows user with access to an MS SQL Server instance is what I’m going to demonstrate.
Setting up a System DSNIn Windows, if you hit the start menu and search for “odbc”, you’ll get an app called “ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit).</description>

      <description>Hello!
This is my very first post; just a quick test as to how a SQL snippet shows in a markdown file and on a website. See below.
select personID, endYear, grade, ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by personID order by endYear, case when grade = &amp;#39;KG&amp;#39; then &amp;#39;00&amp;#39; else grade end) as rowNumfrom #enroll3</description>
