Hello!

This is just a quick test as to how a SQL snipet shows in a markdown file and on a website. See below.

```{sql, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
select personID
	, endYear
	, grade
	, ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by personID order by endYear, case when grade  = 'KG' then '00' else grade end) as rowNum
from #enroll3
```
